# Blinkyboard
I made this project with a tutorial by hackclub, its has 10 leds that will blink.

I made this project to try to get into more hardware! I played with an arduino starter kit a couple years ago but i never got super into it, so i wanted to do this to try again. I've also never soldered before, so this was a really good excuse to learn.

To use my project, you have to connect a 9V battery clip to a couple of header pins on the board (under H1 label) and a 9V battery for it to turn on and blink all of its lights at you!
